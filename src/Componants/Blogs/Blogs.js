                <p> Web browsers treat every element as a kind of box. brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element.  However, CSS has two different types of boxes-block and inline. A block element always starts on a new line, and fills up the horizontal space left and right on the web page. display-block, a line break happens after the element, so a block element doesnâ€™t sit next to other elements. Inline-block It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore.</p>
